# GRAPHS

- Implementation of the graphs


## Challenge

write a graph class that will have all the required methods:

- `AddNode` to Adds a new node to the graph. 
- `AddEdge` Adds a new edge between two nodes in the graph. 
- `GetNodes` return all node in the graph as a collection. 
- `GetNeighbors` Returns a collection of edges connected to the given node. 
- `Size` return the total number of nodes in graph.

## Approach & Efficiency

- create graph class
- create edge class
- create vertex class
- create graph required methods
