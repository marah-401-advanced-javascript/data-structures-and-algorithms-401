# GRAPHS

- Implementation of the graphs


## Challenge

- function that accepts an adjacency list as a graph, and conducts a depth first traversal. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return a collection of nodes in their pre-order depth-first traversal order.

## Approach & Efficiency

- create graph class
- create edge class
- create vertex class
- create graph required methods


## Solution
